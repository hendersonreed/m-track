## midi libraries

- rust midi library (most popular/downloaded, recently updated.)
    - https://docs.rs/midir/0.9.1/midir/
- alternative (doesn't seem to handle the port stuff for you?) 
    - https://crates.io/crates/midly
    - ahhhh seems to wrap midir with maybe better interface?

## slint - rust UI library, supports embedded systems
